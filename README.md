# SEGALE

SEGALE is a tool that allows for the extension of existing sentence-level machine translation metrics to document-level machine translation. Functionally, it is similar to [mwerSegmenter](https://github.com/cservan/MWERalign), which has been used as the long-standing standard for IWSLT evaluation, but offers the following additional benefits:

- More robust performance when encountering over-/under-translation errors
- Does not depend on a reference translation to operate

We will release the code when it's ready. Until then, please refer to our paper.
